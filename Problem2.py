# Coins Change 2

# Time Complexity : O(Sâˆ—n) where S is the amount and n is the coins denominations
# Space Complexity : O(S) as extra space for 2D array(table) is used.
# Did this code successfully run on Leetcode : Yes, Runtime: 540 ms Memory Usage: 30 MB
# Any problem you faced while coding this : Initally yes, After class understanding no.

# Approach
"""
 The Brute force approach of receursion and Greedy algorithm failed so used Dynamic Programming approach which uses 2 dimensional array to solve the problem
 with amount values being rows and coins denominations as columns. Traversing across
 the array and finding the ways which amounts up to i i.e 0 to 11.
