// Your code here along with comments explaining your approach
// Problem 1 is simple idea is that u can paint you house either with r,g,b and that depends on just previous
// house that is the current house if takes blue then we take min of green or red from previous house.

// Coin change 2 is like 0-1 knapsack u chose or u don't chose but here there are infinite number of coins
// so u can chose the same coin which in knapsack was not possible.
