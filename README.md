## Problem2 (https://leetcode.com/problems/coin-change-2/)


## Notes
- Based on the constraint data structure should be picked.  
  - e.g In coin change with target amount we are having 2 inputs so we will be using matrix. 
  - When maximum ways are asked and only coins are provided then array will be used. (House Robber problem)
