Problem: Number of ways for coin change
Time Complexity : O(n^2)
Space Complexity : O(1)
Did this code successfully run on Leetcode : yes
Any problem you faced while coding this : no

Your code here along with comments explaining your approach:
We recursively calculate all the number of ways and build a matrix, the last value in matrix is the answer
