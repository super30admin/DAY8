/*
This approach solves the problem using top-down recursive DP. We use a counter and a 
hash table, to count whenever an output with amount 0 is received, and we use a hash
table for storing whatever configuration of coins gave an amount 0, so that next time
if we encounter the configuration (which we will since the configuration will be repeated
in top-down recursive DP), we will not again increase the counter, as it has already been
set for that configuration.

Problems with this program: It runs, but gives an incorrect answer for some test cases

Did this code run on Leetcode: Yes
